##SF Open Data

[San Francisco Open Data](https://datasf.org/opendata/)

This data set includes different data on things like transportation, 
housing and buildings, public safety, and culture and recreation, all 
pertaining to San Francisco, CA. For example, under transportation 
there is a map that shows different parking regulations throughout the 
city by street. While the data provided here isn’t particularly useful to 
many outside of San Francisco, CA, it is tremendously useful to those who 
live in or near the city. It can help local activist groups push the local 
government to make policy changes that would help benefit those living in 
the city. It could also help businesses try and decide where they’d like to set up shop.



###“The Data Journalism Handbook 1” 

[The Data Journalism Handbook 1](https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/one)


Produced by European Journalism Centre, explores how journalists 
may be able use the vast amounts of data available to them to say, 
aid them in their ability to tell complex stories through use of things 
such as infographics.

This book interested me because I have always been interested and 
fascinated with the field of journalism. And in today’s news landscape, 
compelling and accurate journalism -with the help of accurate data- is 
becoming more and more important to try and stop the spread of misinformation.

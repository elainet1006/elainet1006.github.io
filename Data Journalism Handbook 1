Produced by European Journalism Centre, explores how journalists 
may be able use the vast amounts of data available to them to say, 
aid them in their ability to tell complex stories through use of things 
such as infographics.

This book interested me because I have always been interested and 
fascinated with the field of journalism. And in today’s news landscape, 
compelling and accurate journalism -with the help of accurate data- is 
becoming more and more important to try and stop the spread of misinformation.
